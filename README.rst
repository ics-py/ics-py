Ics.py is a pythonic and easy iCalendar library.
Its goals are to read and write ics data in a developer friendly way.

iCalendar is a widely-used and useful format but not user friendly.
Ics.py is there to give you the ability of creating and reading this
format without any knowledge of it.

It should be able to parse every calendar that respects the
`rfc5545 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545>`_ and maybe some moreâ€¦
It also outputs rfc compliant calendars.

iCalendar (file extension `.ics`) is used by Google Calendar,
Apple Calendar, Android and many more.


Ics.py is available for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and is Apache2 Licensed.

 from datetime import datetime
 from ics import Calendar, Event

 c = Calendar()
 e = Event()
 e.summary = "My cool event"
 e.description = "A meaningful description"
 e.begin = datetime.fromisoformat("2022-06-06T12:05:23+02:00")
 e.end = datetime.fromisoformat("2022-06-06T13:05:23+02:00")
 c.events.append(e)
 c
 # Calendar(extra=Container('VCALENDAR', []), extra_params={}, version='2.0', prodid='ics.py 0.8.0.dev0 - http://git.io/lLljaA', scale=None, method=None, events=[Event(extra=Container('VEVENT', []), extra_params={}, timespan=EventTimespan(begin_time=datetime.datetime(2022, 6, 6, 12, 5, 23, tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=7200))), end_time=None, duration=None, precision='second'), summary=None, uid='ed7975c7-01f1-42eb-bfc4-435afd76b33d@ed79.org', description=None, location=None, url=None, status=None, created=None, last_modified=None, dtstamp=datetime.datetime(2022, 6, 6, 19, 28, 14, 575558, tzinfo=Timezone.from_tzid('UTC')), alarms=[], attach=[], classification=None, transparent=None, organizer=None, geo=None, attendees=[], categories=[])], todos=[])
