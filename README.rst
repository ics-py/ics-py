Ics.py : iCalendar for Humans
=============================

(Release 0.1.1)

Ics.py is a pythonic and easy iCalendar (rfc5545) library. It's goals are to read and write ics data in a developper-friendly way.

It is written in Python (>=2.7 and >=3.3) and is Apache2 Licensed.

iCalendar is complicated, you don't like RFCs but you want/have to use the ics format and you love pythonic APIs? ics.py is for you!

Quickstart
----------


Install using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_.
::

    $ pip install ics


Import a calendar from a file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    from ics import Calendar
    from urllib2 import urlopen # import requests
    url = "http://hackeragenda.urlab.be/events/events.ics"
    c = Calendar(urlopen(url).read().decode('iso-8859-1'))
    # could also use 'requests' here
    # c = Calendar(requests.get(url).text)
    c
    >>> <Calendar with 42 events>

    c.events
    >>> [<Event 'SmartMonday #1' begin:2013-12-13 20:00:00 end:2013-12-13 23:00:00>,
    >>> <Event 'RFID workshop' begin:2013-12-06 12:00:00 end:2013-12-06 19:00:00>,
    >>> ...]

    e = c.events[10]

    "Event '{}' started {}".format(e.name, e.begin.humanize())
    >>> "Event 'Mitch Altman soldering workshop' started 6 days ago"


Create a new calendar and add events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    from ics import Calendar, Event
    c = Calendar()
    e = Event()
    e.name = "My cool event"
    e.begin = '20140101 00:00:00'
    c.events.append(e)

    c.events
    >>> [<Event 'My cool event' begin:2014-01-01 00:00:00 end:2014-01-01 00:00:01>]

Export a Calendar to a file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    with open('my.ics', 'w') as f:
        f.writelines(c)
    # And it's done !

iCalendar-formatted data is also available in a string

.. code-block:: python

    str(c)
    >>> 'BEGIN:VCALENDAR\nPRODID:...
