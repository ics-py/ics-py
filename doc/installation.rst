Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of ics.py.
The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.


Pip
----------------

Installing ics.py is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    $ pip install ics

Virtualenv
----------

You might also want to isolate the ics.py from your system packages.
You can use virtualenvs to that effect::

    $ virtualenv -p python3 ve
    $ source ve/bin/activate
    $ pip install ics

Get the Code
------------

Ics.py is developed on GitHub, where the code is
`always available <https://github.com/C4ptainCrunch/ics.py>`_.

You can either clone the public repository::

    $ git clone git://github.com/C4ptainCrunch/ics.py.git

Download the `master tarball <https://github.com/C4ptainCrunch/ics.py/tarball/master>`_::

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/C4ptainCrunch/ics.py/tarball/master
