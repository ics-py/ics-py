Installing ics.py
=================

Before you can use the library, you need to install it on your system.
There are a couple of ways how to do that.


Check your Python & pip version
-------------------------------

Make sure you have Python available. Type::

    $ python --version

You should get an output like ``3.6.10``. This library needs Python v|minpyver|
at a minimum.
