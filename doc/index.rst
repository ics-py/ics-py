Ics.py : iCalendar for Humans
=============================

(Release |version|)

Ics.py is a pythonic and easy iCalendar (rfc5545) library. It's goals are to read and write ics data in a developer-friendly way.

It is written in Python3 only (3.6 3.7, 3.8 supported) and is  :ref:`Apache2 Licensed <apache2>`.

iCalendar is complicated, you don't like RFCs but you want/have to use the ics format and you love pythonic APIs? ics.py is for you!
