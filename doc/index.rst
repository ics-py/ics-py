Ics.py : iCalendar for Humans
=============================

Release |version|.

Ics.py is a pythonic iCalendar (rfc5545) library.
Its goals are to read and write ics data in a developer-friendly way.

It is written in Python3 only (3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 supported) and is
:ref:`Apache2 Licensed <apache2>`.

iCalendar is complicated, you don't like RFCs but you want/have to use
the ics format and you love pythonic APIs? ics.py is for you!
