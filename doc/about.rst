Ics.py is mostly made by `C4ptainCrunch <http://github.com/C4ptainCrunch/>`_ with some help from iTitou and Rom1.

A big part of the code was written at `UrLab <http://urlab.be>`_, an awesome hackerspace in `ULB <http://ulb.ac.be>`_ in Brussels, Belgium, while beer was helping us with the `Ballmer effect <http://xkcd.com/323/>`_.
