How to submit a pull request

First, before writing your PR, please
`open an issue <http://github.com/ics-py/ics-py/issues/new>`_,
on GitHub to discuss the problem you want to solve and debate on the way
you are solving it. This might save you a lot of time if the maintainers

be solved.

Fixing a bug
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please add a test and add a link to it in the PR description
proving that the bug is fixed.
This will help us merge your PR quickly and above all, this will make
sure that we won't re-introduce the bug later by mistake.

Adding a feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will ask you to provide:

* A few tests showing your feature works as intended (they are also great examples and will prevent regressions)
* Write docstrings on the public API
* Add type annotations where possible
* Think about where and how this will affect documentation and amend
  the respective section

Working on the documentation

Last thing
^^^^^^^^^^

* Please add yourself to :file:`AUTHORS.rst`
* and state your changes in :file:`CHANGELOG.rst`.

.. note::
  Your PR will most likely be squashed in a single commit, authored
  by the maintainer that merged the PR and you will be credited with a
  ``Co-authored-by:`` in the commit message (this way GitHub picks up
  your contribution).

  The title of your PR will become the commit message, please craft it
  with care.
