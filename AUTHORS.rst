* ``utils.iso_precision`` includes something like 10 lines of Arrow's, code,
  which is written by Chris Smith and under Apache license


A big part of the code was written at `UrLab <http://urlab.be>`_, an awesome
hackerspace in `ULB <http://ulb.ac.be>`_ in Brussels, Belgium.

Thanks to:

* `arrow <http://crsmithdev.com/arrow/>`_ which provides a nice API for dates, times and deltas,
* `python-dateutil <http://labix.org/python-dateutil>`_ for parsing timezones from VTIMEZONE blocks,
* `requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_ for giving me inspiration from it's beautiful and pythonic API (and its doc too),
* `six <http://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_ to have made the python3 transition easier,
* `#urlab <irc://freenode.org#urlab>`_ for help and advice.
