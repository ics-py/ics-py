 n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n\n​ PROLOGUE\n\n\n\nCHORUS.\n\n\n\nTwo households\, both
  alike in dignity\,\n\nIn fair Verona\, where we lay our scene\,\n\nFrom an
 cient grudge break to new mutiny\,\n\nWhere civil blood makes civil hands u
 nclean.\n\nFrom forth the fatal loins of these two foes\n\nA pair of star-c
 ross'd lovers take their life\;\n\nWhose misadventur'd piteous overthrows\n
 \nDo\, with their death\, bury their parents' strife.\n\nThe fearful passag
 e of their death-mark'd love\,\n\nAnd the continuance of their parents' rag
 e\,\n\nWhich\, but their children's end\, nought could remove\,\n\nIs now t
 he two hours' traffic of our stage\;\n\nThe which if you with patient ears 
 attend\,\n\nWhat here shall miss\, our toil shall strive to mend.\n\n\n\n\n

 ampson and Gregory\, armed with Swords and Bucklers.\n\n\n\nSam. Gregory\, 
 on my word\, we'll not carry coals.\n\nGre. No\, for then we should be coll
 iers.\n\nSam. I mean\, an we be in choler\, we'll draw.\n\nGre. Ay\, while 
 you live\, draw your neck out of the collar.\n\nSam. I strike quickly\, bei
 ng moved.\n\nGre. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\n\nSam. A dog o
 f the house of Montague moves me.\n\nGre. To move is to stir\, and to be va
 liant is to stand: therefore\, if thou art moved\, thou run'st away.\n\nSam
 . A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the wall of any m
 an or maid of Montague's.\n\nGre. That shows thee a weak slave\; for the we
 akest goes to the wall.\n\nSam. 'Tis true\; and therefore women\, being the
  weaker vessels\,are ever thrust to the wall:—therefore\, I will push Monta
 gue's men from the wall\, and thrust his maids to the wall.\n\nGre. The qua
 rrel is between our masters\, and us their men.\n\nSam. 'Tis all one\, I wi
 ll show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men\, I will be civil 
 with the maids\; I will cut off their heads.\n\nGre. The heads of the maids
 ?\n\nSam. Ay\, the heads of the maids\, or their maidenheads\; take it in w
 hat sense thou wilt.\n\nGre. They must take it in sense\, that feel it.\n\n
 Sam. Me they shall feel\, while I am able to stand\; and 'tis known\, I am 
 a pretty piece of flesh.\n\nGre. 'Tis well\, thou art not fish\; if thou ha
 dst\, ​thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool\; here comes two of the hou
 se of the Montagues.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Abraham and Balthasar.\n\n\n\nSam. My
  naked weapon is out: quarrel\, I will back thee.\n\nGre. How! turn thy bac
 k\, and run?\n\nSam. Fear me not.\n\nGre. No marry: I fear thee!\n\nSam. Le
 t us take the law of our sides\; let them begin.\n\nGre. I will frown as I 
 pass by\, and let them take it as they list.\n\nSam. Nay\, as they dare. I 
 will bite my thumb at them\; which is a disgrace to them\, if they bear it.
 \n\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us\, sir?\n\nSam. I do bite my thumb\, s
 ir.\n\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us\, sir?\n\n\n\nAn image should appe
 ar at this position in the text.\n\nIf you are able to provide it\, see Wik
 isource:Image guidelines and Help:Adding images for guidance.\n\n\n\nSam. I
 s the law of our side\, if I say—ay?\n\nGre. No.\n\nSam. No\, sir\, I do no
 t bite my thumb at you\, sir\; but I bite my thumb\, sir.\n\nGre. Do you qu
 arrel\, sir?\n\nAbr. Quarrel\, sir? no\, sir.\n\nSam. If you do\, sir\, I a
 m for you: I serve as good a man as you.\n\nAbr. No better.\n\nSam. Well\, 
 sir.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Benvolio\, at a distance.\n\n\n\nGre. Say—better: her
 e comes one of my master's kinsmen.\n\nSam. Yes\, better\, sir.\n\nAbr. You
  lie.\n\nSam. Draw\, if you be men.—Gregory\, remember thy swashing blow. [
 They fight.\n\nBen. Part\, fools! put up your swords\; you know not what yo
 u do. [Beats down their Swords.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Tybalt.\n\n\n\nTyb. What! 
 art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\n\nTurn thee\, Benvolio\, look 
 upon thy death.\n\nBen. I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword\,\n\nOr m
 anage it to part these men with me.\n\nTyb. What! drawn\, and talk of peace
 ? I hate the word\,\n\nAs I hate hell\, all Montagues\, and thee.\n\n\n\nHa
 ve at thee\, coward. [They fight.\n\n​ Enter several persons of both Houses
 \, who join the fray\; then enter Citizens\, with clubs or partisans.\n\n\n
 \n1 Cit. Clubs\, bills\, and partisans! strike! beat them down!\n\nDown wit
 h the Capulets! down with the Montagues!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Capulet in his go
 wn\; and Lady Capulet.\n\n\n\nCap. What noise is this?—Give me my long swor
 d\, ho!\n\nLa. Cap. A crutch\, a crutch!—Why call you for a sword?\n\nCap. 
 My sword\, I say!—Old Montague is come\,\n\nAnd flourishes his blade in spi
 te of me.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Montague and Lady Montague.\n\n\n\nMon. Thou vil
 lain Capulet!—Hold me not\; let me go.\n\nLa. Mon. Thou shalt not stir one 
 foot to seek a foe.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Prince\, with his train.\n\n\n\nPrin. 
 Rebellious subjects\, enemies to peace\,\n\nProfaners of this neighbour-sta
 ined steel—\n\nWill they not hear?—what ho! you men\, you beasts\,\n\nThat 
 quench the fire of your pernicious rage\n\nWith purple fountains issuing fr
 om your veins\,\n\nOn pain of torture\, from those bloody hands\n\nThrow yo
 ur mis–temper'd weapons to the ground\,\n\nAnd hear the sentence of your mo
 ved prince.—\n\nThree civil brawls\, bred of an airy word\,\n\nBy thee\, ol
 d Capulet\, and Montague\,\n\nHave thrice disturb'd the quiet of our street
 s\;\n\nAnd made Verona's ancient citizens\n\nCast by their grave beseeming 
 ornaments\,\n\nTo wield old partisans\, in hands as old\,\n\nCanker'd with 
 peace\, to part your canker'd hate.\n\nIf ever you disturb our streets agai
 n\,\n\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace:\n\nFor this time\, al
 l the rest depart away.\n\nYou Capulet\, shall go along with me\;\n\nAnd\, 
 Montague\, come you this afternoon\,\n\nTo know our further pleasure in thi
 s case\,\n\nTo old Free-town\, our common judgment-place.\n\n\n\nOnce more\
 , on pain of death\, all men depart. [Exeunt Prince and Attendants\; Capule
 t\, Lady Capulet\, Tybalt\, Citizens\, and Servants.\n\nMon. Who set this a
 ncient quarrel new abroach?\n\nSpeak\, nephew\, were you by when it began?\
 n\nBen. Here were the servants of your adversary\,\n\nAnd yours\, close fig
 hting ere I did approach.\n\nI drew to part them: in the instant came\n\nTh
 e fiery Tybalt\, with his sword prepar'd\;\n\nWhich\, as he breath'd defian
 ce to my ears\,\n\nHe swung about his head\, and cut the winds\,\n\nWho\, n
 othing hurt withal\, hiss'd him in scorn.\n\nWhile we were interchanging th
 rusts and blows\,\n\nCame more and more\, and fought on part and part\,\n\n
 Till the prince came\, who parted either part.\n\nLa. Mon. O! where is Rome
 o?—saw you him to-day?\n\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\n\nBen. 
 Madam\, an hour before the worshipp'd sun\n\nPeer'd forth the golden window
  of the east\,\n\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad\;\n\nWhere\, unde
 rneath the grove of sycamore\n\nThat westward rooteth from the city's side\
 ,\n\nSo early walking did I see your son.\n\nTowards him I made\; but he wa
 s 'ware of me\,\n\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood:\n\nI\, measuring 
 his affections by my own\,\n\nWhich then most sought\, where most might not
  be found\,\n\nBeing one too many by my weary self\,\n\nPursu'd my humour\,
  not pursuing his\,\n\nAnd gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.\n\nMon. 
 Many a morning hath he there been seen\,\n\nWith tears augmenting the fresh
  morning's dew\,\n\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs:\n\nBu
 t all so soon as the all-cheering sun\n\nShould in the furthest east begin 
 to draw\n\nThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed\,\n\nAway from the light st
 eals home my heavy son\,\n\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself\;\n\nSh
 uts up his windows\, locks fair daylight out\,\n\nAnd makes himself an arti
 ficial night.\n\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove\,\n\nUnless go
 od counsel may the cause remove.\n\nBen. My noble uncle\, do you know the c
 ause?\n\nMon. I neither know it\, nor can learn of him.\n\nBen. Have you im
 portun'd him by any means?\n\nMon. Both by myself\, and many other friends:
 \n\nBut he\, his own affections' counsellor\,\n\nIs to himself—I will not s
 ay\, how true—\n\nBut to himself so secret and so close\,\n\nSo far from so
 unding and discovery\,\n\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm.\n\nEre he
  can spread his sweet leaves to the air\,\n\nOr dedicate his beauty to the 
 sun.\n\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow\,\n\nWe would as wi
 llingly give cure\, as know.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Romeo\, at a distance.\n\n\n\
 nBen. See\, where he comes: so please you\, step aside\;\n\nI'll know his g
 rievance\, or be much denied.\n\nMon. I would\, thou wert so happy by thy s
 tay\,\n\n\n\nTo hear true shrift.—Come\, madam\, let's away. [Exeunt Montag
 ue and Lady.\n\nBen. Good morrow\, cousin.\n\nRom. Is the day so young?\n\n
 Ben. But new struck nine.\n\nRom. Ah me! sad hours seem long.\n\nWas that m
 y father that went hence so fast?\n\nBen. It was. What sadness lengthens Ro
 meo's hours?\n\nRom. Not having that\, which\, having\, makes them short.\n
 \nBen. In love?\n\nRom. Out.\n\nBen. Of love?\n\nRom. Out of her favour\, w
 here I am in love.\n\nBen. Alas\, that love\, so gentle in his view\,\n\nSh
 ould be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\n\nRom. Alas\, that love\, whose v
 iew is muffled still\,\n\nShould\, without eyes\, see pathways to his will!
 \n\nWhere shall we dine?—O me!—What fray was here?\n\nYet tell me not\, for
  I have heard it all.\n\nHere's much to do with hate\, but more with love:\
 n\nWhy then\, O brawling love! O loving hate!\n\nO any thing\, of nothing f
 irst created!\n\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\n\nMis-shapen chaos of 
 well-seeming forms!\n\nFeather of lead\, bright smoke\, cold fire\, sick he
 alth!\n\nStill-waking sleep\, that is not what it is!—\n\nThis love feel I\
 , that feel no love in this.\n\nDost thou not laugh?\n\nBen. No\, coz\; I r
 ather weep.\n\nRom. Good heart\, at what?\n\n\n\n​Ben. At thy good heart's 
 oppression.\n\nRom. Why\, such is love's transgression.-\n\nGriefs of mine 
 own lie heavy in my breast\;\n\nWhich thou wilt propagate\, to have it pres
 se'd\n\nWith more of thine: this love\, that thou hast shown\,\n\nDoth add 
 more grief to too much of mine own.\n\nLove is a smoke\, made with the fume
  of sighs\;\n\nBeing purg'd\, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes\;\n\nBeing v
 ex'd\, a sea nourish'd with lover's tears:\n\nWhat is it else? a madness mo
 st discreet\,\n\nA choking gall\, and a preserving sweet.\n\n\n\nFarewell\,
  my coz. [Going.\n\nBen. Soft\, I will go along:\n\nAnd if you leave me so\
 , you do me wrong.\n\nRom. Tut! I have lost myself: I am not here\;\n\nThis
  is not Romeo\, he's some other where.\n\nBen. Tell me in sadness\, who is 
 it that you love.\n\nRom. What! shall I groan\, and tell thee?\n\nBen Groan
 ! why\, no\;\n\nBut sadly tell me\, who.\n\nRom. Bid a sick man in sadness 
 make his will\;\n\nA word ill urg'd to one that is so ill.-\n\nIn sadness\,
  cousin\, I do love a woman.\n\nBen. I aim'd so near\, when I suppos'd you 
 lov'd.\n\nRom. A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.\n\nBen. A righ
 t fair mark\, fair coz\, is soonest hit.\n\nRom. Well\, in that hit\, you m
 iss: she'll not be hit.\n\nWith Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit\;\n\nAnd
  in strong proof of chastity well arm'd\,\n\nFrom love's weak childish bow 
 she lives unharm'd\n\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms\,\n\nNor 
 bide th' encounter of assailing eyes\,\n\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing
  gold:\n\nO! she is rich in beauty\; only poor\,\n\nThat when she dies with
  beauty dies her store.\n\nBen. Then she hath sworn\, that she will still l
 ive chaste?\n\nRom. She hath\, and in that sparing makes huge waste\;\n\nFo
 r beauty\, starv'd with her severity\,\n\nCuts beauty off from all posterit
 y.\n\nShe is too fair\, too wise\; wisely too fair\,\n\nTo merit bliss by m
 aking me despair:\n\nShe hath forsworn to love\, and in that vow\n\nDo I li
 ve dead\, that live it to tell it now.\n\nBen. Be rul'd by me\; forget to t
 hink of her.\n\nRom. O! teach me how I should forget to think.\n\nBen. By g
 iving liberty unto thine eyes:\n\nExamine other beauties.\n\nRom. 'Tis the 
 way\n\nTo call her's\, exquisite\, in question more.\n\nThese happy masks\,
  that kiss fair ladies' brows\,\n\nBeing black\, put us in mind they hide t
 he fair:\n\nHe\, that is stricken blind\, cannot forget\n\nThe precious tre
 asure of his eyesight lost.\n\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair\,\n\
 nWhat doth her beauty serve\, but as a note\n\nWhere I may read who pass'd 
 that passing fair?\n\nFarewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.\n\nBen. 
 I'll pay that doctrine\, or else die in debt. [Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn image

 n\n\n(Verona.)\n\n\n\n\n\n​ Scene II.—A Street.\n\nEnter Capulet\, Paris\, 
 and Servant.\n\n\n\nCap. But Montague is bound as well as I\,\n\nIn penalty
  alike\; and 'tis not hard\, I think\,\n\nFor men so old as we to keep the 
 peace.\n\nPar. Of honourable reckoning are you both\;\n\nAnd pity 'tis\, yo
 u liv'd at odds so long.\n\nBut now\, my lord\, what say you to my suit?\n\
 nCap. But saying o'er what I have said before\;\n\nMy child is yet a strang
 er in the world\,\n\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years:\n\nLet
  two more summers wither in their pride\,\n\nEre we may think her ripe to b
 e bride.\n\nPar. Younger than she are happy mothers made.\n\nCap. And too s
 oon marr'd are those so early made.\n\nEarth hath swallowed all my hopes bu
 t she\,\n\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth:\n\nBut woo her\, gentle Par
 is\, get her heart\,\n\nMy will to her consent is but a part\;\n\nAn she ag
 ree\, within her scope of choice\n\nLies my consent and fair according voic
 e.\n\nThis night I hold an old accustom'd feast\,\n\nWhereto I have invited
  many a guest\,\n\nSuch as I love\; and you among the store\,\n\nOne more m
 ost welcome\, makes my number more.\n\nAt my poor house look to behold this
  night\n\nEarth-treading stars\, that make dark heaven light:\n\nSuch comfo
 rt\, as do lusty young men feel\,\n\nWhen well-apparel'd April on the heel\
 n\nOf limping winter treads\, even such delight\n\nAmong fresh female buds 
 shall you see this night\n\nInherit at my house: hear all\, all see\,\n\nAn
 d like her most\, whose merit most shall be:\n\nWhich\, on more view of man
 y\, mine being one\,\n\nMay stand in number\, though in reckoning none-\n\n
 Come\, go with me—Go\, sirrah\, trudge about\n\nThrough fair Verona\; find 
 those persons out\,\n\n\n\nWhose names are written there\, and to give them
  say\, [Giving a paper.\n\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay. [Ex
 eunt Capulet and Paris.\n\nServ. Find them out\, whose names are written he
 re? It is written\, that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard\, and th
 e tailor with his last\, the fisher with his pencil\, and the painter with 
 his nets\; but I am sent to find those persons\, whose names are here writ\
 , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ. I must t
 o the learned:—in good time.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Benvolio and Romeo.\n\n\n\nBe
 n. Tut\, man! one fire burns out another's burning\,\n\n⁠One pain lessen'd 
 by another's anguish\;\n\nTurn giddy\, and be holp by backward turning\;\n\
 n⁠One desperate grief cures with another's languish:\n\nTake thou some new 
 infection to thy eye\,\n\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die.\n\nRom. 
 Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.\n\nBen. For what\, I pray thee?\n
 \nRom. For your broken shin.\n\nBen. Why\, Romeo\, are thou mad?\n\nRom. No
 t mad\, but bound more than a madman is:\n\nShut up in prison\, kept withou
 t my food\,\n\nWhipp'd and tormented\, and—Good-den\, good fellow.\n\nServ.
  God gi' good den.—I pray\, sir\, can you read?\n\nRom. Ay\, mine own fortu
 ne in my misery.\n\nServ. Perhaps you have learn'd it without book\; but I 
 pray\, can you read anything you see?\n\nRom. Ay\, if I know the letters\, 
 and the language.\n\nServ. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry.\n\nRom. Stay\, 
 fellow\; I can read. [Reads.\n\n"Signior Martino\, and his wife\, and daugh
 ters\; County Anselme\, and his beauteous sisters\; the lady widow of Vitru
 vio\; Signior Placentio\, and his lovely nieces\; Mercutio\, and his brothe
 r Valentine\; mine uncle Capulet\, his wife\, and daughters\; my fair niece
  Rosaline\; Livia\; Signior Valentio\, and his cousin Tybalt\; Lucio\, and 
 the lively Helena."\n\nA fair assembly\; whither should they come?\n\nServ.
  Up.\n\nRom. Whither? to supper?\n\nServ. To our house.\n\nRom. Whose house
 ?\n\nServ. My master's.\n\nRom. Indeed\, I should have asked you that befor
 e.\n\nServ. Now\, I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich
  Capulet\; and if you be not of the house of Montagues\, I pray\, come and 
 crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry. [Exit.\n\nBen. At this same ancient fe
 ast of Capulet's\n\nSups the fair Rosaline\, whom thou so lov'st\,\n\nWith 
 all the admired beauties of Verona:\n\nGo thither\; and\, with unattainted 
 eye\,\n\nCompare her face with some that I shall show\,\n\nAnd I will make 
 thee think thy swan a crow.\n\nRom. When the devout religion of mine eye\n\
 n⁠Maintains such falsehood\, then turns tears to fires\;\n\nAnd these\, who
 \, often drown'd\, could never die\,\n\n⁠Transparent heretics\, be burnt fo
 r liars.\n\nOne fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun\n\nNe'er saw her ma
 tch\, since first the world begun.\n\nBen. Tut! you saw her fair\, none els
 e being by\,\n\nHerself pois'd with herself in either eye\;\n\nBut in those
  crystal scales\, let there be weigh'd\n\nYour lady's love against some oth
 er maid\,\n\nThat I will show you shining at this feast\,\n\nAnd she shall 
 scant show well\, that now shows best.\n\nRom. I'll go along\, no such sigh
 t to be shown\,\n\n\n\nBut to rejoice in splendour of mine own. [Exeunt.\n\

 se.\n\n\n\nLa. Cap. Nurse\, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.\n\nN
 urse. Now\, by my maiden-head at twelve year old\,\n\nI bade her come—What\
 , lamb! what\, lady-bird!—\n\nGod forbid!—where's this girl?—what\, Juliet!
 \n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Juliet.\n\n\n\nJul. How now! who calls?\n\nNurse. Your mo
 ther.\n\nJul. Madam\, I am here.\n\nWhat is your will?\n\nLa. Cap. This is 
 the matter.—Nurse\, give leave awhile\,\n\nWe must talk in secret.—Nurse\,

 Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.\n\nNurse. 'Faith\, I can tell h

 She is not fourteen. How long is it now\n\nTo Lammas-tide?\n\n\n\n​La. Cap.
  A fortnight\, and odd days.\n\nNurse. Even or odd\, of all days in the yea
 r\,\n\nCome Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.\n\nSusan and she\,—G
 od rest all Christian souls!—\n\nWere of an age.—Well\, Susan is with God\;
 \n\nShe was too good for me. But\, as I said\,\n\nOn Lammas-eve at night sh
 all she be fourteen\;\n\nThat shall she\, marry: I remember it well.\n\n'Ti
 s since the earthquake now eleven years\;\n\nAnd she was wean'd\,—I never s
 hall forget it\,—\n\nOf all the days of the year\, upon that day\;\n\nFor I
  had then laid wormwood to my dug\,\n\nSitting in the sun under the dove-ho
 use wall:\n\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua.—\n\nNay\, I do bear a bra
 in:—but\, as I said\,\n\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\n\nOf
  my dug\, and felt it bitter\, pretty fool\,\n\nTo see it tetchy\, and fall
  out with the dug!\n\nShake\, quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need\, I trow\
 ,\n\nTo bid me trudge.\n\nAnd since that time it is eleven years\;\n\nFor t
 hen she could stand alone\; nay\, by the rood\,\n\nShe could have run and w
 addled all about\,\n\nFor even the day before she broke her brow:\n\nAnd th

 should live a thousand years.\n\nI never should forget it: "Wilt thou not\,
  Jule?" quoth he:\n\nAnd\, pretty fool\, it stinted\, and said—"Ay."\n\nLa.
  Cap. Enough of this: I pray thee: hold they peace.\n\nNurse. Yes\, madam. 
 Yet I cannot choose but laugh\,\n\nTo think it should leave crying\, and sa
 y—"Ay:"\n\nAnd yet\, I warrant\, it had upon its brow\n\nA bump as big as a
  young cockerel's stone\,\n\nA perilous knock\; and it cried bitterly.\n\n"
 Yea\," quoth my husband\, "fall'st upon thy face?\n\nThou wilt fall backwar
 d\, when thou com'st to age\;\n\nWilt thou not\, Jule?" it stinted\, and sa
 id—"Ay."\n\nJul. And stint thou too\, I pray thee\, nurse\, say I.\n\nNurse
 . Peace\, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\n\nThou was the pretties
 t babe that e'er I nurs'd:\n\nAn I might live to see thee married once\,\n\

  came to talk of:—tell me\, daughter Juliet\,\n\nHow stands your dispositio
 n to be married?\n\nJul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\n\nNurse. An 
 honour! were not I thine only nurse\,\n\nI would say\, thou hadst sucked wi
 sdom from thy teat.\n\nLa. Cap. Well\, think of marriage now\; younger than
  you\,\n\nHere in Verona\, ladies of esteem\,\n\nAre made already mothers: 
 by my count\,\n\nI was your mother\, much upon these years\n\nThat you are 
 now a maid. Thus\, then\, in brief\;—\n\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for hi
 s love.\n\nNurse. A man\, young lady! lady\, such a man\,\n\nAs all the wor
 ld—Why\, he's a man of wax.\n\nLa. Cap. Verona's summer hath not such a flo
 wer.\n\nNurse. Nay\, he's a flower\; in faith\, a very flower.\n\nLa. Cap. 
 What say you? can you love the gentleman?\n\nThis night you shall behold hi
 m at out' feast:\n\nRead o'er the volume of young Paris' face\,\n\nAnd find
  delight writ there with beauty's pen.\n\nExamine every married lineament\,
 \n\nAnd see how one another lends content\;\n\nAnd what obscur'd in this fa
 ir volume lies\,\n\nFind written in the margin of his eyes.\n\nThis preciou
 s book of love\, this unbound lover\,\n\nTo beautify him\, only lacks a cov
 er:\n\nThe fish lives in the sea\; and 'tis much pride\,\n\nFor fair withou
 t the fair within to hide.\n\nThat book in many's eyes doth share the glory
 \,\n\nThat in gold clasps locks in the golden story\;\n\nSo shall you share
  all that he doth possess\,\n\nBy having him making yourself no less.\n\nNu
 rse. No less? nay\, bigger: women grow by men.\n\nLa. Cap. Speak briefly\, 
 can you like of Paris' love?\n\nJul. I'll look to like\, if looking liking 
 move\;\n\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\,\n\nThan your consent gi
 ves strength to make it fly.\n\nEnter a Servant.\n\n\n\nServ. Madam\, the g
 uests are come\, supper served up\, you called\, my young lady asked for\, 
 the nurse cursed in the pantry\, and every thing in extremity. I must hence
  to wait\; I beseech you\, follow straight.\n\nLa. Cap. We follow thee. Jul
 iet\, the county stays.\n\nNurse. Go\, girl\, seek happy nights to happy da
 ys. [Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n\nScene IV.—A Street.\n\nEnter Romeo\, Mercutio\, Ben
 volio\, with five or six Maskers\, Torch-bearers\, and others.\n\n\n\nRom. 
 What\, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse\,\n\nOr shall we on withou
 t apology?\n\nBen. The date is out of such prolixity:\n\nWe'll have no Cupi
 d hood-wink'd with a scarf\,\n\nBearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath\,\n\
 nScaring the ladies like a crow-keeper\;\n\nNor no without-book prologue\, 
 faintly spoke\n\nAfter the prompter\, for our entrance:\n\nBut\, let them m
 easure us by what they will\,\n\nWe'll measure them a measure\, and be gone
 .\n\nRom. Give me a torch\; I am not for this ambling:\n\nBeing but heavy\,
  I will bear the light.\n\nMer. Nay\, gentle Romeo\, we must have you dance
 .\n\nRom. Not I\, believe me. You have dancing shoes\,\n\nWith nimble soles
 \; I have a soul of lead\,\n\nSo stakes me to the ground\, I cannot move.\n
 \nMer. You are a lover: borrow Cupid's wings\,\n\nAnd soar with them above 
 a common bound.\n\nRom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft\,\n\nTo soar
  with his light feathers\; and so bound\,\n\nI cannot bound a pitch above d
 ull woe:\n\nUnder love's heavy burden do I sink.\n\nMer. And\, to sink in i
 t\, should you burden love\;\n\nToo great oppression for a tender thing.\n\
 nRom. Is love a tender thing? it is too rough\,\n\nToo rude\, too boisterou
 s\; and it pricks like thorn.\n\nMer. If love be rough with you\, be rough 
 with love\;\n\nPrick love for pricking\, and you beat love down.—\n\n\n\nGi
 ve me a case to put my visage in: [Putting on a mask.\n\nA visor for a viso
 r!—what care I\,\n\nWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?\n\nHere are th
 e beetle-brows shall blush for me.\n\nBen. Come\, knock\, and enter\; and n
 o sooner in\,\n\nBut every man betake him to his legs.\n\nRom. A torch for 
 me: let wantons\, light of heart\,\n\nTickle the senseless rushes with thei
 r heels\;\n\nFor I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase\,—\n\nI'll be a can
 dle-holder\, and look on:\n\nThe game was ne'er so fair\, and I am done.\n\
 nMer. Tut! dun's the mouse\, the constable's own word.\n\nIf thou art dun\,
  we'll draw thee from the mire\n\nOf this save-reverence love\, wherein tho
 u stick'st\n\nUp to the ears.—Come\, we burn day-light\, ho.\n\nRom. Nay\, 
 that's not so.\n\nMer. I mean\, sir\, in delay\n\nWe waste our lights in va
 in\, like lamps by day.\n\nTake our good meaning\, for our judgment sits\n\
 nFive times in that\, ere once in our five wits.\n\nRom. And we mean well i
 n going to this mask\,\n\nBut 'tis no wit to go.\n\nMer. Why\, may one ask?
 \n\nRom. I dreamt a dream to-night?\n\nMer. And so did I.\n\nRom. Well\, wh
 at was yours?\n\nMer. That dreamers often lie.\n\nRom. In bed asleep\, whil
 e they do dream things true.\n\nMer. O! then\, I see\, queen Mab hath been 
 with you.\n\nShe is the fairies' midwife\; and she comes\n\nIn shape no big
 ger than an agate-stone\n\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman\,\n\nDrawn wit
 h a team of little atomies\n\nOver men's noses as they lie asleep:\n\nHer w
 aggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs\;\n\nThe cover\, of the wings of g
 rasshoppers\;\n\nThe traces\, of the smallest spider's web\;\n\nThe collars
 \, of the moonshine's watery beams:\n\nHer whip\, of cricket's bone\; the l
 ash\, of film:\n\nHer waggoner\, a small grey-coated gnat\,\n\nNot half so 
 big as a round little worm\n\nPrick'd from the lazy finger of a maid.\n\nHe
 r chariot is an empty hazel-nut\,\n\nMade by the joiner squirrel\, or old g
 rub\,\n\nTime out of mind the fairies' coach-makers.\n\nAnd in this state s
 he gallops night by night\n\nThrough lovers' brains\, and then they dream o
 f love: ​\n\nOn courtiers' knees\, that dream on court'sies straight:\n\nO'
 er lawyers' fingers\, who straight dream on fees:\n\nO'er ladies' lips\, wh
 o straight on kisses dream\;\n\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagu
 es\,\n\nBecause their breaths with sweet-meats tainted are.\n\nSometime she
  gallops o'er a courtier's nose\,\n\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a s
 uit:\n\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\,\n\nTickling a pars
 on's nose as 'a lies asleep\;\n\nThen he dreams of another benefice.\n\nSom
 etime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck\,\n\nAnd then dreams he of cutting 
 foreign throats\,\n\nOf breaches\, ambuscadoes\, Spanish blades\,\n\nOf hea
 lths five fathom deep\; and then anon\n\nDrums in his ear\, at which he sta
 rts\, and wakes\;\n\nAnd\, being thus frighted\, swears a prayer or two\,\n
 \nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\,\n\nThat plats the manes of hors
 es in the night\;\n\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs\,\n\nWh
 ich\, once untangled\, much misfortune bodes.\n\nThis is the hag\, when mai
 ds lie on their backs\,\n\nThat presses them\, and learns them first to bea
 r\,\n\nMaking them women of good carriage.\n\nThis\, is she—\n\nRom. Peace\
 , peace! Mercutio\, peace!\n\nThou talk'st of nothing.\n\nMer. True\, I tal
 k of dreams\,\n\nWhich are the children of an idle brain\,\n\nBegot of noth
 ing but vain fantasy\;\n\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air\;\n\nAnd
  more inconstant than the wind\, who woos\n\nEven now the frozen bosom of t
 he north\,\n\nAnd\, being anger'd\, puffs away from thence\,\n\nTurning his
  face to the dew-dropping south.\n\nBen. This wind\, you talk of\, blows us
  from ourselves\;\n\nSupper is done\, and we shall come too late.\n\nRom. I
  fear\, too early\; for my mind misgives\,\n\nSome consequence\, yet hangin
 g in the stars\,\n\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\n\nWith this nigh
 t's revels\; and expire the term\n\nOf a despised life\, clos'd in my breas
 t\,\n\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death:\n\nBut He\, that hath the st
 eerage of my course\,\n\nDirect my sail.—On\, lusty gentlemen.\n\nBen. Stri

  Servants.\n\n\n\n1 Serv. Where's Potpan\, that he helps not to take away? 
 he shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!\n\n2 Serv. When good manners sha
 ll lie all in one or two men's hands\, and they unwashed too\, 'tis a foul 
 thing.\n\n1 Serv. Away with the joint-stools\, remove the court-cupboard\, 
 look to the plate.—Good thou\, save ​me a piece of marchpane\; and\, as tho
 u lovest me\, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone\, and Nell.—Antony! an
 d Potpan!\n\n2 Serv. Ay\, boy\; ready.\n\n1 Serv. You are looked for\, and 
 called for\, asked for\, and sought for\, in the great chamber.\n\n2 Serv. 
 We cannot be here and there too.—Cheerly\, boys: be brisk awhile\, and the 
 longer liver take all. [They retire behind.\n\nEnter Capulet\, &c.\, with t

 ha\, my mistresses! which of you all\n\nWill now deny to dance? she that ma
 kes dainty\, she\,\n\nI'll swear\, hath corns. Am I come near you now?\n\nY
 ou are welcome\, gentlemen! I have seen the day\,\n\nThat I have worn a vis

 would please:—'tis gone\, 'tis gone\, 'tis gone.\n\nYou are welcome\, gentl

 nAh! sirrah\, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.\n\nNay\, sit\, nay\, sit\
 , good cousin Capulet\,\n\nFor you and I are past our dancing days:\n\nHow 
 long is't now\, since last yourself and I\n\nWere in a mask?\n\n2 Cap. By'r
  lady\, thirty years.\n\n1 Cap. What\, man! 'tis not so much\, 'tis not so 
 much:\n\n'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio\,\n\nCome Pentecost as quickly 
 as it will\,\n\nSome five and twenty years\; and then we mask'd.\n\n2 Cap. 
 'Tis more\, 'tis more: his son is elder\, sir\;\n\nHis son is thirty.\n\n1 
 Cap. Will you tell me that?\n\nHis son was but a ward two years ago.\n\nRom
 . What lady is that\, which doth enrich the hand\n\nOf yonder knight?\n\nSe
 rv. I know not\, sir.\n\nRom. O! she doth teach the torches to burn bright.
 \n\nHer beauty hangs upon the cheek of night\n\nLike a rich jewel in an Æth
 iop's ear\;\n\nBeauty too rich for use\, for earth too dear!\n\nSo shows a 
 snowy dove trooping with crows\,\n\nAs yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.\
 n\nThe measure done\, I'll watch her place of stand\,\n\nAnd\, touching her
 s\, make blessed my rude hand.\n\nDid my heart love till now? forswear it\,
  sight!\n\nI never saw true beauty till this night.\n\nTyb. This\, by his v
 oice\, should be a Montague.—\n\nFetch me my rapier\, boy.—What! dares the 
 slave\n\nCome hither\, cover'd with an antic face\,\n\nTo fleer and scorn a
 t our solemnity?\n\nNow\, by the stock and honour of my kin\,\n\nTo strike 
 him dead I hold it not a sin.\n\n1 Cap. Why\, how now\, kinsman! wherefore 
 storm you so?\n\nTyb. Uncle\, this is a Montague\, our foe\;\n\nA villain\,
  that is hither come in spite\,\n\nTo scorn at our solemnity this night.\n\
 n1 Cap. Young Romeo is it?\n\nTyb. 'Tis he\, that villain Romeo.\n\n1 Cap. 
 Content thee\, gentle coz\, let him alone\,\n\nHe bears him like a portly g
 entleman\;\n\nAnd\, to say truth\, Verona brags of him\,\n\nTo be a virtuou
 s and well-govern'd youth.\n\nI would not for the wealth of all this town\,
 \n\nHere\, in my house\, do him disparagement\;\n\nTherefore\, be patient\,
  take no note of him:\n\nIt is my will\; the which if thou respect\,\n\nSho
 w a fair presence\, and put off these frowns\,\n\nAn ill-beseeming semblanc

 he shall\;—go to\;—\n\nAm I the master here\, or you? go to.\n\nYou'll not 
 endure him! God shall mend my soul—\n\nYou'll make a mutiny among my guests
 .\n\nYou will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!\n\nTyb. Why\, uncle\, 'ti
 s a shame.\n\n1 Cap. Go to\, go to\;\n\nYou are a saucy boy.—Is't so\, inde
 ed?—\n\nThis trick may chance to scath you\;—I know what.\n\nYou must contr
 ary me! marry\, 'tis time—\n\nWell said\, my hearts!—You are a princox\; go
 :—\n\nBe quiet\, or—More light\, more light!—for shame!\n\nI'll make you qu
 iet\;—What!—Cheerly\, my hearts!\n\nTyb. Patience perforce with wilful chol

 ushing pilgrims\, ready stand\n\n⁠To smooth that rough touch with a tender

 nnerly devotion shows in this\;\n\nFor saints have hands that pilgrims' han
 ds do touch\,\n\n⁠And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\n\nRom. Have not 
 saints lips\, and holy palmers too?\n\nJul. Ay\, pilgrim\, lips that they m
 ust use in prayer.\n\nRom. O! then\, dear saint\, let lips do what hands do
 \;\n\nThey pray\, grant thou\, lest faith turn to despair.\n\nJul. Saints d

 word with you.\n\nRom. What is her mother?\n\nNurse. Marry\, bachelor\,\n\n
 Her mother is the lady of the house\,\n\nAnd a good lady\, and a wise\, and
  virtuous.\n\nI nurs'd her daughter\, that you talk'd withal\;\n\nI tell yo
 u—he that can lay hold of her\n\nShall have the chinks.\n\n\n\n​Rom. Is she
  a Capulet?\n\nO\, dear account! my life is my foe's debt.\n\nBen. Away\, b
 egone: the sport is at the best.\n\nRom. Ay\, so I fear\; the more is my un

 fling foolish banquet towards.—\n\nIs it e'en so? Why then\, I thank you al
 l\;\n\nI thank you\, honest gentlemen\; good night:—\n\nMore torches here!—
 Come on\, then let's to bed.\n\nAh\, sirrah\, by my fay\, it waxes late\;\n

 io.\n\nJul. What's he\, that now is going out of door?\n\nNurse. Marry\, th
 at\, I think\, be young Petruchio.\n\nJul. What's he\, that follows here\, 
 that would not dance?\n\nNurse. I know not.\n\nJul. Go\, ask his name.—If h
 e be married\,\n\nMy grave is like to be my wedding bed.\n\nNurse. His name
  is Romeo\, and a Montague\;\n\nThe only son of your great enemy.\n\nJul. M
 y only love sprung from my only hate!\n\nToo early seen unknown\, and known
  too late!\n\nProdigious birth of love it is to me\,\n\nThat I must love a 
 loathed enemy.\n\nNurse. What's this? what's this?\n\nJul. A rhyme I learn'
 d even now\n\nOf one I danc'd withal. [One calls within\, Juliet!\n\nNurse.
  Anon\, anon:\n\nCome\, let's away\; the strangers all are gone. [Exeunt.\n

 \nAnd young affection gapes to be his heir:\n\nThat fair\, for which love g

 \n\nNow Romeo is belov'd\, and loves again\,\n\nAlike bewitched by the char

  love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:\n\nBeing held a foe\, he may not hav
 e access\n\nTo breathe such vows as lovers use to swear\;\n\nAnd she as muc
